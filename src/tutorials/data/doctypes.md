# DocTypes overview

In Cozy, data is represented as CouchDB [documents](./queries.md#basic-concepts). Each document follows a specific structure, called a DocType, stored in its dedicated database.

You can find [here](https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-doctypes/docs/) a list of all the DocTypes available in Cozy.

Cozy is an open platform: if you need a DocType that does not exist yet, you can submit a new one by making a Pull Request in the Github [repository](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-doctypes/tree/master/docs).
